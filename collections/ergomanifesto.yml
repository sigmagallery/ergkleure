    The ability for a citizen to dissent in any free society is generally the
    only legal means they have to effect change. Absent the ability to dissent;
    society is not free. Connecting centralized access, reward mechanisms, or
    conformity to digital money currency is weaponizing money against thought,
    freedom of speech and expression.

    Privacy must remain an option to protect the individual, and it does not
    have to be forced; let people make their own choices.

    Centralized programmable digital money sounds like an efficient technical
    upgrade to the existing monetary infrastructure. In some areas, this may be
    the case. However, it appears that the basic constructs of money are in the
    beginning stages of an era that will further weaponize money against the
    average human. Current fiat-based monetary systems attack ordinary citizens
    by creating persistent inflationary pressures.

    Privacy is a matter of trust, and the lack of privacy demonstrates a lack of
    confidence. A lack of trust cannot be the foundation of a healthy society.
    Healthy societies are built on cooperation, and voluntary cooperation is, in
    and of itself, an exercise in trust.

    Like in most jurisdictions on earth, the average citizen of every country
    has essentially zero power over monetary policy. The average citizen lacks
    the tools that corporations, criminal organizations, terrorist
    organizations, and the wealthy have to protect themselves and benefit from
    financial difficulties. Financial circumstances were created by the same
    powers that now hold their wealth hostage.

    Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Small
    businesses struggling to make ends meet, not big depersonalized financial
    capital.

    The collective social contract has generally been that your money is yours.
    It is your property, your asset. Restricting or limiting consumers' access
    to spending their wealth is a power we must all fear and resist. Although
    legalization has prevented access to specific markets, products and
    services, cash has remained sovereign. This pillar of freedom must be
    respected. This potentially could destroy the concept of a free market.

    Privacy is the ability to create barriers and erect boundaries to create a
    space for the individual. It is up to each what borders and boundaries they
    choose to make.

    The Ergo Manifesto hopes to educate and offer a vision of what blockchain
    technology can achieve. We hope to build society through horizontal
